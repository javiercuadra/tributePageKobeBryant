          played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the
          Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant won many accolades:

            Selected 13th overall in the NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets out
            of Lower Merion High in Pennsylvania. Bryant was quickly traded to

            In his rookie season, Bryant won the Slam Dunk Contest at NBA
            All-Star Weekend, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to
            ever do so. In Game 5 of the second round of the playoffs against
            the Utah Jazz, he infamously shot four airballs as the Lakers were
            eliminated. He was named to the All-Rookie second team after his
            first campaign.

            assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee. The charges

            In his final NBA game, Bryant put forth a vintage performance,
            scoring 60 points against the Jazz in a 101-96 Lakers win, becoming
            the oldest player in NBA history to score 60 in a game. That is also
            the most points any NBA player has ever scored in his final game. He
            finished his career with 33,643 points, which was third in NBA
            history until James surpassed the mark on
