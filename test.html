              We interviewed two current Phd students at different levels in the
              program. One student had been in the program for the last 8 years
              and was about to complete his/her dissertation. The other student
              had been in the program for a year and was planning on trasfering
              out of the program. We also interviewed the program director and
              co-ordinator.

              We conducted a cognitive walkthrough with 2 students in the
              master's program to see if the current website was navigatable. We
              chose partcipants who had never used the website before.We wanted
              to study their information seeking behaviour.

              We looked at the content on the current website and also
              everything that was available in the Phd handbook. We also looked
              and other on-campus sites like the graduate school website, the
              international students website and the course registeration
              website to find all the content that a current or prospective
              student could access.
